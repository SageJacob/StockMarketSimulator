Privacy Policy
Last updated April 28th, 2021.

Building the APK resulted in the following error: 

Your app has an apk with version code 1 that requests the following permissions: android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE, android.permission.CAMERA, android.permission.READ_CONTACTS, android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO. Apps using these permissions in an APK are required to have a privacy policy set.


While these permissions are requested, none are used. No data is collected from the user except when we store login credentials (in which the userâ€™s password is encrypted) and their in-app portfolios into our database. 

Please be aware that this app is merely the result of a class project. It will be minimally maintained and security may be not be optimal so please do not use credentials that you use anywhere else.
